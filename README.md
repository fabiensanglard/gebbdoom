# Game Engine Black Book: Doom

This is the source code for the Game Engine Black Book: Doom.
I am releasing the source code (.tex) under GPL license. I
retain ownership of all drawings and only provide them so the
overall thing is compilable.

    - or via Homebrew: `brew cask install xquartz inkscape`
 - Install MacTeX library (for epstopdf and pdflatex):

    - or via Homebrew, with GUI:    `brew cask install mactex`
