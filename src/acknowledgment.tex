Many people helped completing this book. Many thanks are due:\\
\par
To John Carmack, John Romero, and Dave Taylor for sharing their memories of \doom{} development and answering my many questions.\\

concernedly close.\\

Thanks to Stephane Lopez. I never forgot the first time I saw \doom{} running on his IBM PS2 486 SX 33Mhz. That clicky keyboard also initiated an ever lasting love for good keyboard.\\

To Jim Leonard who once again volunteered his time and encyclopedic knowledge of audio hardware and software (the Roland section was heavily based on his articles).\\
\par
To Foone Turing who volunteered their fleet of 386s, 486s, and ISA/VLB VGA cards to accurately benchmark \doom{}.\\
