After shipping Wolfenstein 3D in May 1992, id Software went right back to work. The team of five (John Carmack, John Romero, Adrian Carmack, Tom Hall and Kevin Cloud) split in two. While part of the team would focus on Wolfenstein 3D's Hint Manual and Spear of Destiny, another faction built the technology which would power the next title.\\
\par
The development of \doom{} really started in January 1993 with an impressive press release by Tom Hall\protect\footnote{see Appendix \ref{label_pressrelease}} promising ground-breaking technology and unprecedented gameplay. Within just eleven months they managed to have the shareware version ready in time for Christmas. No less than thirteen people would end up being involved.\\

In January of 1995, Electronic Games magazine ran a series of three articles for the release of \doomii{}. This presented an opportunity to gather all members of the id team in a group photo.\\

 \par The "plank" in the photo is John Romero's office door and the hole was the making of John Carmack.\\
  \par
\fq{Well, Romero's door jammed one day. He was in his office and was trapped in there,
and we couldn't get the door open. It was after-hours, so we couldn't call building
maintenance, and we were all standing around trying to figure out what to do, when
it occurred to me and I said, "You know, I do have a battle axe in my office."\\
\par
Yes, this thing really works.}{John Carmack}






\section{Location}
Fed up with the winter of Wisconsin, the studio relocated in November 1992. They left behind the cold of Madison and settled in the Town East Tower in Mesquite TX, better known as the "Black Cube".\\

In an interview for the book "Masters of Doom", Tom Hall recounts how all the team members settled into the new environment.\\
\par
\fq{On the first day, each guy chose his space. Carmack and Romero took side-by-side offices, while Adrian and Kevin, who were growing increasingly close, decided to share a space. Tom liked an open corner spot in a large room with a window. "This would be a great office area," he said, "we just need to put some walls up." The rest agreed. But the walls were slow to come. Whenever Tom asked Jay about it, Jay would say they were on their way. Out of humor and frustration, Tom put down two long strips of masking tape where the walls of what he called his creative corner would go.}{David Kushner, Masters of Doom}

\fq{I remember companies would send us free sound cards all the time, so many that we took to using them as ninja throwing stars at one point and would throw them into the kitchen wall opposite my desk.}{Dave Taylor}





\section{Creative direction}
The tone of the new title was to be much darker than the previous games. Initially intending to adapt the movie Aliens (1986), the team decided against it in order to retain total creative control\footnote{Amusingly, one of the best mod of all time would be the total conversion "Aliens TC.}. They wanted to do something scary, inspired by movies such as Evil Dead, The Thing, and The Fly and they wanted it to be as aggressive as the metal music they usually listened to.\\
\par
Even the name of the next title would be to inspire fear. The idea would come from John Carmack while watching the movie "The Color of Money".\\ 
\par
Midway through the movie, Vincent, played by Tom Cruise, enters a pool bar carrying one of the best pool cues in the world, a Balabushka. Confident and committed on unleashing his skills upon his opponents, he is noticed by one of the locals, Moselle. Intrigued by the pool cue case he asks Vincent: "What you got in there?". "In Here?" exclaims Vincent, looking up and smiling maliciously: "DOOM!".\\

The game they envisioned would go way beyond what they had accomplished with Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny. \doom{} would have eight weapons and seventeen types of opponent. The hero would fight countless demons. And there would be a lot of gibs\footnote{"gibs" is short for "giblets" and they often argued about the pronunciation.}.
